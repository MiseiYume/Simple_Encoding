# Simple encoding and decoding
Program with encryption and decryption methods having impact on the string-type input provided by user. 

## General info
It's a small program, with no fireworks letting you alter your input string a bit by hard-coded dictionary.

It has a typical error handling message altough only for one exception - and the only one I could think of about in such a short program.

The syntax has been checked with Flake8 and altered according to the PEP8 formatting rules.

## Requirements
The requirements are in the "requirements.txt" - after downloading the repository you may just use "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the project's folder and you'll be set to go. 

Anyway the requirements are:

flake8==3.9.2 
mccabe==0.6.1 
pycodestyle==2.7.0 
pyflakes==2.3.1
